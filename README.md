# compare-dataviz-tools

The aim is to compare langages or software to create static and interactive dataviz

For that, we use global temperature data from [Climate Research Unit](http://www.cru.uea.ac.uk/). The data are available in the following page :
https://crudata.uea.ac.uk/cru/data/temperature/
