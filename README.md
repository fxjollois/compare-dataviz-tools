# compare-dataviz-tools

The aim is to compare langages or software to create static and interactive dataviz.

For that, we use global temperature data from [Climate Research Unit](http://www.cru.uea.ac.uk/). The data are available in the following page :
https://crudata.uea.ac.uk/cru/data/temperature/

The HadCRUT4 data file was downloaded the **June 1st 2017**, and converted into an adapted format for each langage.

## Direct access to dataviz
